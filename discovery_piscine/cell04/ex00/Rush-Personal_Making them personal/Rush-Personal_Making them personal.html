<b>UN goal 3-Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages</b>
<br>
The UN goal 3 looks at ensuring health for people, and making sure everyone has access to health and a medical system. This is a big deal, especially in the United Nations, because so many people don’t have access, or can’t afford access to the medical system, or live in such a state of poverty that there is no way they would be able to get the medical help they need. This is a big problem, as every human deserves a right to a medical system, and no one should have to suffer in pain, or even die simply because they were unable to afford the medical care they needed.
